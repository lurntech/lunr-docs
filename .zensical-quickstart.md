# Zensical Quick Reference

## Common Commands

```bash
# Start development server
zensical serve

# Build for production
zensical build

# Check version
zensical --version

# Get help
zensical --help
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Start coding:**
   ```bash
   zensical serve
   ```
   Opens at http://localhost:8000 with live reload

2. **Edit files:**
   - Modify Markdown files in `docs/`
   - Changes appear instantly in browser
   - Check console for any errors

3. **Build for deployment:**
   ```bash
   zensical build
   ```
   Output in `site/` directory

## Configuration Tips

- Keep using `mkdocs.yml` - fully compatible
- All your existing Material for MkDocs settings work
- Markdown extensions configured in `mkdocs.yml` are respected
- Navigation structure remains the same

## Performance Notes

Zensical is significantly faster than MkDocs:
- Built with Rust for native performance
- Parallel processing of pages
- Optimized asset handling
- Typical builds: **1-2 seconds** (vs 10-30s with MkDocs)

## Troubleshooting

### Build errors?
- Check `mkdocs.yml` syntax
- Verify all referenced files exist
- Look for plugin compatibility issues

### Slow builds?
- Clear `site/` directory: `rm -rf site`
- Check for large images (optimize them)
- Review custom extensions

### Missing features?
- Check [Zensical roadmap](https://zensical.org/about/roadmap/)
- Some plugins may not be implemented yet
- File issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/zensical/zensical/issues)

|--------|--------|----------|
| Language | Python | Rust + Python |
| Build Speed | Slower | Much faster |
| Plugin System | Extensive | Growing |
| Configuration | YAML | YAML or TOML |
| Compatibility | - | MkDocs compatible |
