# Mission Control

## Overview

The Mission Control application is a powerful tool designed for support teams to take full control of Lunar Hardware devices remotely. The tool empowers support agents with the tools to observe device or app-related issues as they happen, as well as quickly reproduce issues on affected devices.

Mission Control has two modes of operation, including:

* Locked mode - it locks the device from further use by the user until Mission Control mode is terminated. Users are unable to operate through any of the device buttons or the device screen;
* Silent mode - Mission Control runs in the background without notifying the user. The user can operate the device as needed.&#x20;
