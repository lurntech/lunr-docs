Applications can be grouped in clusters, based on their general purpose. The clusters include:

**Control cluster:** collection of applications used to remotely configure device policies, permissions, and UI.&#x20;

**Support cluster:** collection of applications helping support teams remotely diagnose and troubleshoot issues with devices, including collection of device logs and remote access.

**Ops cluster:** collection of applications for key day to day operations, including device enrollment, software updates, device notifications.
